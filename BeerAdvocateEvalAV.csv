The sandstone colored cap that is currently filling the upper third of the pint glass looks to be a tight collection of glassine bubbles rather than heavily creamy foam. It still looks wonderful and is leaving thick sheets of cheesecloth-like lace.The nose comes close to matching the quality of the appearance. That said, more power and more roasted maltiness would be great. Might there be beechwood-smoked malt in there? This could be interesting.As a relatively light, sweet stout, Otter Mon isn't bad. It isn't outstanding either, but I'm trying to look on the bright side. Simply put, the depth of flavor that would have resulted from more malt isn't present. The somewhat cocoa-like, somewhat coffee-like, somewhat smoky flavor skates along the top of the taste buds without really digging in. A bit of background tanginess is a negative as well.Shouldn't foreign/export stouts be bigger than this? Considering the fact that the added cane sugar should be bulking things up a little, the lack of heft is disappointing. Since the beer is still incredibly smooth and silky, I've decided to go with the next highest score.My hope was that Otter Mon Jamaican-style Stout would be at least as good as Wolaver's Farmhouse Ale, a beer that I enjoyed earlier this week. It isn't, but that doesn't mean it isn't a worthwhile purchase. Just don't expect the gold standard for the style.

Pours on the heavy side with almost no head. What head there is, is bright white and slightly sticky. Lacing is decent, but not too crazy. Smell: Resin, citrus rind/zest, faint spiciness, and a big floral push. Big juicy, oily hops. Smells like a crazy wet hop beer. The hop aromas are incredibly fresh and clean. Malts are sweet and bready, but work to flesh out the back of the big hop nose. Caramel and cotton candy as well. The sweetness is a little distracting overall, working in contrast to the hops.Taste: Pine everywhere. Dank, resinous, and juicy. Hops are oily and spread across the mouth. The sweetness from the nose brightens the whole thing up and lets you know more is coming. I'm still getting cotton candy and caramel in abundance, but they play through the back of the hop profile. A hint of something tropical (mango?) as well. Tons of flavor, but it's shockingly non-aggressive. Big chewy malt presence helps even things out.Mouthfeel: This might be a new standard for the style. Low carbonation and a big chewy body. Creamy, smooth, and almost silly drinkable. Coats the mouth, dries it out a touch, and then keeps on going with waves of smooth hop flavor.
