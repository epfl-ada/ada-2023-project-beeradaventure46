It was poured into my petite Duvel tulip.Houblon Chouffe Dobbelen IPA Tripel pours a mildy hazy sunshine yellow. Three fingers or so of white foam rise up to top the beer. Head retention and lacing are both decent, but neither particularly impresses. The nose isn't too potent, but it does have some pleasant apricot/fruity and earthy/spicy aromas. The flavor is a much better display of the fusion between tripel and IPA that makes up this beer. Pear and apricot stone fruit esters open things up, and fade beautifully into some more tropical fruity hoppiness. The bitterness that rolls through next is notable, but not overly aggressive. The finish is the same earthy, spicy, noble hop note from the nose, I'm guessing courtesy of the Saaz hops. If a little bit of a phenol presence could ave been integrated the beer would be just about perfect. The mouthfeel was a little bit of a letdown. Simultaneously, the body was a little chewy and the carbonation fell a bit on the dull side. That aside, Houblon Chouffe is a great Belgian IPA, displaying the harmonies that can exist between American hopping and Belgian yeast strains.",2715,1198,4.2,9.0,739,708,1249466400.0,"United States, New Jersey",Belgium,20,bottle

A nice white head develops in true robust wheat fashion, but does not last as long as the heads I recall from others of my typical wheat beer experiences. Lace in the shape of a snail appears making me crave garlic slathered escargot. Later as the snail shrinks as if salted, the remainder of the lacing clings for only seconds, then oozes back from whence it came as if alive. All the while active carbonation launches to the surface. The snail now looks bizarrely like a dog with a very long neck.The smell is noticeably clove laiden at first sniff. There are traces of narn, that would be banana, and also a peculiar lemon meringue effect. Wheat aspects are abundant for reasons that do not seem hard to ascertain. Ultimately a wafting air biscuit of light and bouncy textures.The taste holds the aforementioned clove in high prestige. There is a nice air fluffed wheatiness that is both a mouthfeel and a taste somehow simultaneously. Not a lot here to comment on, but just what I had presumed would make itself known. Typical light and watery, spice/clove, and weird fruit effects of the narn persuasion and lemon fluff.Mouthfeel is light. Light and appropriate and nothing out of the usual.Drinkability is good. Very gaseous and belch provoking at the same time which may prompt a cautionary advisory. Overall fine. Do not expect to be compelled into fits of joyous ranting and things of this nature.

A slight sweetness from the malt barely carries through. Hoppy. The first taste is a rush of thick, sweet, resinous, all-American hoppy goodness fading to a nice bitter aftertaste that persists for a while. The malt easily balances the bitterness, first sweet and bready followed by an unexpected dry finish that lingers with the residual bitterness. As the beer warms the dryness becomes more evident, nicely contrasting the initial sweetness. The bitterness really does build in this beer, a quality that may decrease with aging -- who knows I'm not that patient. The mouthfeel is thick, but not overly so, again nicely complemented by the clean dryness that becomes progressively evident.

It isn't outstanding either, but I'm trying to look on the bright side. Simply put, the depth of flavor that would have resulted from more malt isn't present. The somewhat cocoa-like, somewhat coffee-like, somewhat smoky flavor skates along the top of the taste buds without really digging in. A bit of background tanginess is a negative as well.Shouldn't foreign/export stouts be bigger than this? Considering the fact that the added cane sugar should be bulking things up a little, the lack of heft is disappointing. Since the beer is still incredibly smooth and silky, I've decided to go with the next highest score.My hope was that Otter Mon Jamaican-style Stout would be at least as good as Wolaver's Farmhouse Ale, a beer that I enjoyed earlier this week. It isn't, but that doesn't mean it isn't a worthwhile purchase. Just don't expect the gold standard for the style.

The color starts as a mellow, peachy orange and deepens to a ruddy burnt orange. A vigorous swirl yields a thin skin of foam the color of white pepper.S- A big, piney hop aroma cuts through a foundation of malt, burnt sugar and sweetened oat cereal, with notes of honeysuckle and alcohol and a whiff of blackberries. Very promising.T- Very sweet and tart at first, like lemon curd. Then there's a strong vegetable/floral note in the middle, like the smell of geraniums. It is odd and off-putting. The finish is full of earthy, herbal bitterness and it lasts forever. Through the middle and finish, the fruity character changes from lemon to something more tropical (notes of pineapple and guava). My tastebuds are tingling a full minute and a half after the first swallow.M- This beer could really use more carbonation. The mouthfeel is milky and heavy like tepid canned nectar. It coats my mouth in a way I don't like very much. Feh.D- Not very drinkable. The bombastic, long-lasting flavors are side-swiped by a lack of carbonation.

Pours on the heavy side with almost no head. What head there is, is bright white and slightly sticky. Lacing is decent, but not too crazy. Smell: Resin, citrus rind/zest, faint spiciness, and a big floral push. Big juicy, oily hops. Smells like a crazy wet hop beer. The hop aromas are incredibly fresh and clean. Malts are sweet and bready, but work to flesh out the back of the big hop nose. Caramel and cotton candy as well. The sweetness is a little distracting overall, working in contrast to the hops.Taste: Pine everywhere. Dank, resinous, and juicy. Hops are oily and spread across the mouth. The sweetness from the nose brightens the whole thing up and lets you know more is coming. I'm still getting cotton candy and caramel in abundance, but they play through the back of the hop profile. A hint of something tropical (mango?) as well. Tons of flavor, but it's shockingly non-aggressive. Big chewy malt presence helps even things out.Mouthfeel: This might be a new standard for the style. Low carbonation and a big chewy body. Creamy, smooth, and almost silly drinkable. Coats the mouth, dries it out a touch, and then keeps on going with waves of smooth hop flavor.

I have to say, I am impressed.  Definitely one of the better beers I have had in awhile.  I poured it into a tulip glass, and the first thing I noticed was the beautiful dark copper color and a nice creamy colored head, about 2 fingers in length.  I would also like to mention the temperature of the beer was probably around 50-60 degrees, not sure exactly how much, but this beer was only in my fridge for about an hour before I decided to give it a try.Upon taking my first sip, I noticed the subtle and pleasant aroma of the hops.  The beer itself is not as hoppy, or bitter as I expected.  What I tasted the most was the malts coming through, to give it a slightly sweet, yet pleasant and clean finish.Lastly,I was suprised to find out about the High ABV rating, for a beer that is almost 9% ABV it sure went down smooth.

It smells of fleshy, semi-sweet, and pungent mango puree, mildly biscuity pale malt, and a weirdly zingy, indistinct, um, hoppiness, I guess. The taste is way too sweet isolated sugar-addled grain, saccharine mango flesh, and sweet, sugary, oh, wait, no, the rather faint earthy hops happen to be the only thing that is not seemingly over the top, well, sweet, in this particular concoction.

So I went to the beer fridge and I had a few stouts, which I like with steak, but I wanted to try something different. Stout with garlic and butter noddles doesn't really appeal. I then remembered that I had bought this beer for just such a pairing. If you're gonna put black pepper in a beer, I'm gonna serve it with a steak...a well-seasoned one at that. And this did not disappoint in the pairing. If I didn't know what I had poured I would have guessed this were a dunkel weizen from all the banana and cloves put out there in the nose. Yes, it smells more German than Belgian to me and I'll be damned if I can get through the yeast's esters and phenols to pick out any black pepper. So, although I really like the smell I have to knock it down for not smelling as it ought to. And yes, I smelled it before I took my first bite of steak. The look is really nice: a dark but light-bodied, crisp, dry beer with a 1&quot; stand of tan foam on top, leaving behind bands of thick lace. It's upon the first sip that you find out what this beer is all about. The black pepper comes alive here and it has a nice bite up on the sides of the upper palate and it doesn't let go easily as it moves on back. The banana is barely there at all and may be a remnant from the nose. This is truly a dark saison in which the pepper has been left as the commanding spice to act as an equal with the grass-like grains. It struck real harmonious notes with my steak, each complimenting the other nicely with the noodles adding a counterpoint that the beer easily cut through.The bottle says that it will continue to develop for up to five years, but I'm not sure I'd lay down a 6% ABV beer for that long...you'd definitely need to make sure your cellar conditions were perfect, but I'm inclined to trust the brewer on this. If it did survive one would hope that the pepper would mellow. If that were the case then this would be a remarkable beer. It might be worth getting another bottle to try it out with a nice, well-seasoned steak of course.EDIT - After much deliberation I lowered the Taste score. After I was done eating I proceeded to polish off the bottle and the black pepper became more and more assertive and astringent. This was not noticed when paired with the steak, but the score needed to reflect the beer as a stand-alone...not everyone will be having a nice steak with it. So if you get this, make sure you've got enough steak to last through the whole bottle.",1792,506,3.76,6.4,490,463,1272103200.0,"United States, New Jersey","United States, Illinois",869,bottle

A light bitterness comes and goes with a hint of alcohol in the ending of the beer. Full of flavor from start to finish with this beer.M- Medium mouthfeel. Carbonation is good for the style. Medium high drying on the palate from the alcohol and I would say the smoke flavor as well. Light roast and smoke left on the palate. Tons of smoke with a hint of alcohol left in the aftertaste. The flavor was balanced enough for the style with the smoke outlasting the malt in the overall balance. Clean flavors overall which some might argue since the smoke profile is so high.D- The overall drinkability is high. The smoke does cut down this lightly. ABV is low and well hidden.

Just FYI, my favorite black lager is Moonlight’s Death &amp; Taxes, although I know that it is a bit of a radical when it comes to the style. I’ve had other schwarzbiers that failed miserably—usually too malty and not enough roast—and some that were exceptional. Drank this one while rewatching the Cohen bro’s Miller’s Crossing.

I received a healthy amount of billowy foam that died down into a creamy ring around the glass. Cold, the malt dominates on the nose. I expect more roast to come through on the aroma as it warms although the malt maintains the upper hand. Mildly roasted, no harsh edges. It’s definitely a black lager, pours a dark chocolate with some light showing at the edges. Just barely. Glad to see a black lager that lives up to its name, judging from simple appearances.First sip gives me a lot of that maltiness. It’s rich, but not heavy. Not thin bodied, either, but somewhere in between say a porter and a brown or amber ale. I definitely get a front-loaded sweetness that turns dry on the end. It’s well carbonated, and the carbonation keeps it from feeling heavy in spite of the malt body.

Huge aroma of grapefruit and rich citrus hops are all over the one. Nice balance of light buttery malts as it warms, but this one was truly a hop monster, just what I wanted indeed. First sip nearly ripped the tongue out of my mouth with a bitter joy. Huge ripe grapefruit notes, rich touches of pineapple, and the tongue buckling hops that pierced right through to your soul. Huge flavor here that really did not stop. Very floral and fresh with an enormous bitter flair to it. Just and immense IPA by all accounts.

This retains with a tight and creamy ½ finger, which whips up a foamy cascade that slowly recedes down the sides of the glass and leaves back thick swathes of clingy lace. The soft creamy richness of the head very much looks a nitro pour here. Impressive. The aroma has a fresh leafy and citric feel to it, with a fair amount of spice as well. Unfortunately not a whole lot of the malt is coming through here, with maybe just some light sweetness and roast sitting along the sides and back of this. Hops definitely sit at the forefront of this though, especially those peppery spice notes. The taste is green citrus throughout, with a moderate bitterness and like the nose, pretty darn spicy. Chalky feeling chocolate malt and a coffee roastiness surround the hops but this overall isn’t coming off as flavorful as it feels like it wants to be. The finish is dry and pity with some lingering spice. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a VERY smooth and creamy feel that packs a bit of crispness into it as well. The overall silky presence and easy drinking nature of this almost has this feeling like it is on nitro (just like that rich look from the pour). A robust look and easy drinking body were about the highlights here for me, as this came off as overly leafy and spicy feeling and just not as overall flavorful as I was expecting it to be.
