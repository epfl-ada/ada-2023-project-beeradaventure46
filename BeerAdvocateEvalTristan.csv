It was poured into my petite Duvel tulip.Houblon Chouffe Dobbelen IPA Tripel pours a mildy hazy sunshine yellow. Three fingers or so of white foam rise up to top the beer. Head retention and lacing are both decent, but neither particularly impresses. The nose isn't too potent, but it does have some pleasant apricot/fruity and earthy/spicy aromas. The flavor is a much better display of the fusion between tripel and IPA that makes up this beer. Pear and apricot stone fruit esters open things up, and fade beautifully into some more tropical fruity hoppiness. The bitterness that rolls through next is notable, but not overly aggressive. The finish is the same earthy, spicy, noble hop note from the nose, I'm guessing courtesy of the Saaz hops. If a little bit of a phenol presence could ave been integrated the beer would be just about perfect. The mouthfeel was a little bit of a letdown. Simultaneously, the body was a little chewy and the carbonation fell a bit on the dull side. That aside, Houblon Chouffe is a great Belgian IPA, displaying the harmonies that can exist between American hopping and Belgian yeast strains.",2715,1198,4.2,9.0,739,708,1249466400.0,"United States, New Jersey",Belgium,Brasserie d'Achouffe,20,bottle

A nice white head develops in true robust wheat fashion, but does not last as long as the heads I recall from others of my typical wheat beer experiences. Lace in the shape of a snail appears making me crave garlic slathered escargot. Later as the snail shrinks as if salted, the remainder of the lacing clings for only seconds, then oozes back from whence it came as if alive. All the while active carbonation launches to the surface. The snail now looks bizarrely like a dog with a very long neck.The smell is noticeably clove laiden at first sniff. There are traces of narn, that would be banana, and also a peculiar lemon meringue effect. Wheat aspects are abundant for reasons that do not seem hard to ascertain. Ultimately a wafting air biscuit of light and bouncy textures.The taste holds the aforementioned clove in high prestige. There is a nice air fluffed wheatiness that is both a mouthfeel and a taste somehow simultaneously. Not a lot here to comment on, but just what I had presumed would make itself known. Typical light and watery, spice/clove, and weird fruit effects of the narn persuasion and lemon fluff.Mouthfeel is light. Light and appropriate and nothing out of the usual.Drinkability is good.

The malt easily balances the bitterness, first sweet and bready followed by an unexpected dry finish that lingers with the residual bitterness. As the beer warms the dryness becomes more evident, nicely contrasting the initial sweetness. The bitterness really does build in this beer, a quality that may decrease with aging -- who knows I'm not that patient.

It is overall pretty faint early on, even with a swirl. But the inputs all balance and play well together. I notice vague spiciness later, and it all gets stronger, though still subtle and nuanced. Upped the score to 4 late in the sample...A whee nip of wheat right away is followed by lemony tartness and a faint hint of malty sweetness. The Bret funk is present, but very much in balance. Light spiciness is hard to find underneath the lemon, but it's there. Mild hop bitterness is most noticeable in the finish, as is the oak barrel. The many subtle inputs are very much in balance and proportionate. I am impressed. Well but not overcarbonated.
