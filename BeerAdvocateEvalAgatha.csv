It is solid black, with a long lasting, frothy dark tan head. Leaves nice lacing on the plastic. The nose contains of course roast, but also vanilla, and a bit of a berry fruitiness. Very light. Somehow, this beer has a very off taste. It is very bitter in a roasted way, which is fine (although a bit over-roasted, it seems), with an odd berry flavor (hinted at in the nose), which fortunately recedes as it warms (quick in the August sun). The mouthfeel is somewhat thin, and less carbonated than appreciated. Overall, the beer loses so much for the foreign tasting berry flavor.

Its fresh and inviting nose displays a generous amount of caramel-laced, biscuity malt accented by lightly floral and grassy hops. The body is medium and its fine carbonation is crisp in the mouth. The flavor reflects exactly what the aroma suggests with a gently caramelish and biscuity malt that's accented by floral, leafy and slightly grassy hops backed by a solid bitterness. It's quite delicately balanced with a bitterness that allows the malt to come through but still restrains it. It never steps out of line, but doesn't back down either; and it finishes dry with a short-lingering note of caramelish malt and floral hop. Surprisingly, on the back label they compare this delicate beauty to some sulphur-ridden, hard-muscled swilll from Britain... and it's certainly not!

So I went to the beer fridge and I had a few stouts, which I like with steak, but I wanted to try something different. Stout with garlic and butter noddles doesn't really appeal. I then remembered that I had bought this beer for just such a pairing. If you're gonna put black pepper in a beer, I'm gonna serve it with a steak...a well-seasoned one at that. And this did not disappoint in the pairing. If I didn't know what I had poured I would have guessed this were a dunkel weizen from all the banana and cloves put out there in the nose. Yes, it smells more German than Belgian to me and I'll be damned if I can get through the yeast's esters and phenols to pick out any black pepper. So, although I really like the smell I have to knock it down for not smelling as it ought to. And yes, I smelled it before I took my first bite of steak. The look is really nice: a dark but light-bodied, crisp, dry beer with a 1&quot; stand of tan foam on top, leaving behind bands of thick lace. It's upon the first sip that you find out what this beer is all about. The black pepper comes alive here and it has a nice bite up on the sides of the upper palate and it doesn't let go easily as it moves on back. The banana is barely there at all and may be a remnant from the nose. This is truly a dark saison in which the pepper has been left as the commanding spice to act as an equal with the grass-like grains. It struck real harmonious notes with my steak, each complimenting the other nicely with the noodles adding a counterpoint that the beer easily cut through.The bottle says that it will continue to develop for up to five years, but I'm not sure I'd lay down a 6% ABV beer for that long...you'd definitely need to make sure your cellar conditions were perfect, but I'm inclined to trust the brewer on this. If it did survive one would hope that the pepper would mellow. If that were the case then this would be a remarkable beer. It might be worth getting another bottle to try it out with a nice, well-seasoned steak of course.EDIT - After much deliberation I lowered the Taste score. After I was done eating I proceeded to polish off the bottle and the black pepper became more and more assertive and astringent. This was not noticed when paired with the steak, but the score needed to reflect the beer as a stand-alone...not everyone will be having a nice steak with it.

Light streaks of lace on the sides of the glass with some spotty lace here and there. S- Wow...smokey smokey smokey! Roasted malts come through in the front with light hints of chocolate malts as well. The applewood wood comes through a lot in the smoke. The charred wood comes through from the medium of the nose to the ending growing strength as it warms up.T- Roasted malts in the front of the beer with light hints of chocolate in a bittersweet way. There is a underlying roasted flavor throughout the beer but from the middle on the smoked flavor reigns supreme. Charred wood and hints of smoked apple come and go never dying down at all. A light bitterness comes and goes with a hint of alcohol in the ending of the beer. Full of flavor from start to finish with this beer.M- Medium mouthfeel. Carbonation is good for the style. Medium high drying on the palate from the alcohol and I would say the smoke flavor as well. Light roast and smoke left on the palate. Tons of smoke with a hint of alcohol left in the aftertaste. The flavor was balanced enough for the style with the smoke outlasting the malt in the overall balance. Clean flavors overall which some might argue since the smoke profile is so high.D- The overall drinkability is high. The smoke does cut down this lightly. ABV is low and well hidden. The base porter would be a fine beer all by itself but adding the smoke element gives it a little more complexity which makes this all the more enjoyable. A fine first beer I had from this company.
