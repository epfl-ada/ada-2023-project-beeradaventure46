Just FYI, my favorite black lager is Moonlight’s Death &amp; Taxes, although I know that it is a bit of a radical when it comes to the style.

I expect more roast to come through on the aroma as it warms although the malt maintains the upper hand. Mildly roasted, no harsh edges. It’s definitely a black lager, pours a dark chocolate with some light showing at the edges. Just barely. Glad to see a black lager that lives up to its name, judging from simple appearances.First sip gives me a lot of that maltiness. It’s rich, but not heavy. Not thin bodied, either, but somewhere in between say a porter and a brown or amber ale. I definitely get a front-loaded sweetness that turns dry on the end.

Huge aroma of grapefruit and rich citrus hops are all over the one. Nice balance of light buttery malts as it warms, but this one was truly a hop monster, just what I wanted indeed. First sip nearly ripped the tongue out of my mouth with a bitter joy. Huge ripe grapefruit notes, rich touches of pineapple, and the tongue buckling hops that pierced right through to your soul.

This retains with a tight and creamy ½ finger, which whips up a foamy cascade that slowly recedes down the sides of the glass and leaves back thick swathes of clingy lace. The soft creamy richness of the head very much looks a nitro pour here. Impressive. The aroma has a fresh leafy and citric feel to it, with a fair amount of spice as well. Unfortunately not a whole lot of the malt is coming through here, with maybe just some light sweetness and roast sitting along the sides and back of this. Hops definitely sit at the forefront of this though, especially those peppery spice notes. The taste is green citrus throughout, with a moderate bitterness and like the nose, pretty darn spicy. Chalky feeling chocolate malt and a coffee roastiness surround the hops but this overall isn’t coming off as flavorful as it feels like it wants to be. The finish is dry and pity with some lingering spice. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a VERY smooth and creamy feel that packs a bit of crispness into it as well. The overall silky presence and easy drinking nature of this almost has this feeling like it is on nitro (just like that rich look from the pour).
