Wheat, boozy malt and a semi-sweet yeast flavour predominate.M – Fairly high carbonation makes this remarkably refreshing for a fairly strong and dark beer.

I get more of a session IPA vibe than the expected witbier base, at least initially, although there is a solid undercurrent of Belgian seed spice and dry phenols. Grapefruit, lime, and some mango complement the lemon on the nose. The combination of Belgian yeast and citrus hops recalls ginger root, in a way.

Made with 62% 'Fairtrade' mango content, apparently - good to know!This beer pours a slightly hazy, medium golden straw colour, with one fat-ass finger of puffy, tightly foamy, and essentially soapy off-white head, the sort not long for this world, and gives up a bit of layered cloud-form lace upon its speedy exit. It smells of fleshy, semi-sweet, and pungent mango puree, mildly biscuity pale malt, and a weirdly zingy, indistinct, um, hoppiness, I guess. The taste is way too sweet isolated sugar-addled grain, saccharine mango flesh, and sweet, sugary, oh, wait, no, the rather faint earthy hops happen to be the only thing that is not seemingly over the top, well, sweet, in this particular concoction. The carbonation is pretty much plainly frothy, in a sort of deaf and mute sense, the body medium-heavy in that cloying simple syrup manner, so 'smooth', I guess, if that's your thing. It finishes still pretty bloody sweet, the earthy, somewhat musty mango character the only thing somewhat capable of meekly pointing in the other direction.Upon closer inspection of the label, it comes as no surprise that this is actually brewed by the good folks at Huyghe in Belgium, as this duly resonates with memories of their Ninkeberry fruit-fuck of a 'beer'.
